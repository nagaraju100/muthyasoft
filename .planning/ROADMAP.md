# Roadmap: Data Engineering Tutoring Platform

## Overview

A straightforward journey from zero to deployed landing page: establish technical foundation with modern web framework, build responsive UI with all content sections, integrate contact form with email delivery, and deploy to production. Four focused phases deliver a professional tutoring landing page that connects students with an experienced data engineering practitioner.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Technical infrastructure and framework setup
- [ ] **Phase 2: Design & Content** - Responsive UI with all content sections
- [ ] **Phase 3: Contact Integration** - Contact form with email delivery
- [ ] **Phase 4: Deployment** - Production deployment and domain configuration

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Technical infrastructure is ready for development with modern framework and project structure
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: TECH-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Modern web framework (React/Next.js or equivalent) is installed and configured
  2. Project structure follows framework best practices with proper organization
  3. Development server runs successfully on localhost
  4. Basic page renders with framework's default styling
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 2: Design & Content
**Goal**: Professional landing page is fully designed with responsive layout and complete content
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DESIGN-01, DESIGN-02, DESIGN-03, DESIGN-04, CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03, CONTENT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visitor viewing on mobile, tablet, or desktop sees properly formatted page
  2. Hero section clearly communicates value proposition of working with experienced data engineer
  3. Topics/expertise section displays full data engineering stack (Python, PySpark, Databricks, Airflow, AWS/GCP/Azure)
  4. About section showcases 10+ years enterprise background with company credentials
  5. How tutoring works section explains 1-on-1 format and personalized approach
  6. Clear call-to-action buttons prompt visitors to reach out via contact form
  7. Page loads in under 3 seconds on standard connection
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 3: Contact Integration
**Goal**: Contact form is functional with email delivery and social media links are integrated
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: CONTACT-01, CONTACT-02, CONTACT-03, CONTACT-04, TECH-02, TECH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visitor can fill out contact form with name, email, and message
  2. Form validates input and displays clear error messages for invalid data
  3. Successful form submission sends email to tutor's inbox
  4. Links to TechGeniusMinds YouTube channel open correctly in new tab
  5. Links to Medium blog and LinkedIn profile are visible and functional
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 4: Deployment
**Goal**: Live site is accessible on production domain with all features working
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: TECH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Site is deployed to hosting platform with HTTPS enabled
  2. Custom domain points to deployed site and loads successfully
  3. All features work identically to localhost environment (responsiveness, form, links)
  4. Contact form delivers emails from production environment
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
